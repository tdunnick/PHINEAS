  This configures the items and look of the console configuration
  form.  

  "Tab" creates a selection tab with "Name"

  "Input" creates a form input field of "Type"

  The "Tab.Prefix" is combined with the "Input.Suffix" to create
  a tag path into the configuration being edited. This path is also
  used for the default "Name" and the suffix to construct the default
  "Prompt".  

  If a "Tab" has "Repeats", a subtab is created for each repeated
  set of "Input"s with one extra "NEW" tab.

  If an "Input" has "Repeats", a "Add" button will be present to
  add additional copies of the field.

  "Help" tags contain the "bubble" help tips text for a given
  input.

      The Queue Type identifies the fields of Queue, although the physical
      implementation may include additional fields and/or have
      order differences. Queue Types should begin with a "RECORDID" field.
      EbXml queues are expected to have a specific set of fields present,
      so you should NOT delete any found there. 
      The EbXml defaults are fully compatible with existing
      PHINMS databases.
