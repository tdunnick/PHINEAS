    <p>
      This guide is written to be a hands on step by step
      description for configuring <b>Phineas</b>. It assumes you
      have a basic understanding of concepts like digital
      certificates, HTTP/HTTPS protocols, XML, and PHIN-MS
      terminology. The keyword here is <b>HOW</b>. To successfully
			configure <b>Phineas</b> (or most software) you generally need to know
			<b>WHAT</b> you want to configure and <b>WHY</b> you need to configure it.
			A careful read through the 
      <b>Phineas</b> <a href="console.html?help.html">HELP</a> documentation 
			will provide some of this information.  And please take the time to
			read through the rest of this <b>General Information</b>
			as HOW TO's common to all procedures will be found here.
    </p>
		<p>
		  I'll try to stick to the terms "Sender" and "Receiver" to identify
			to two primary functions of Phineas (e.g. sending files and 
			receiving files).  However, you should consider these to be
			synonymous with the more commonly used "Client" (a.k.a. "Sender")
			and "Server" (a.k.a. "Receiver")	terminology.  This is especially
			helpful to remember when studying external documentation
			(openSSL for example).
		</p>
		<p>
		  Finally, this is not intended to be an exhaustive guide.  Configuration
			items that are used for "tuning" or changing behavior that is not
			specific to establishing transport are not covered here.
		</p>
		<hr/>
    <div class="heading">
      <a name="console" class="section" id=
      "console">The Configuration Console</a><br>
      <a href="#contents">(return to contents)</a>
    </div>
		<p>
		  The following also assumes you are using a more or less stock
			console configuration.  Since the console is user configurable,
			you may see different naming or positions for these settings.
			Some may even be missing if <b>Phineas</b> configuration
			has been "locked down".  Again, refer to the 
			<a href="console.html?help.html">HELP</a>
			documentation for a complete description of the various 
			values within the XML configuration.
		</p>
		<p>
		  To access the console from the GUI, right click the Phineas Icon
			<img src="images/favicon.ico" alt="Phineas Icon" />
			in the bottom right hand corner service tray. From that menu
			pick "console" and your default browser will open. If you are not
			running the GUI, or want to access the console directly from
			a browser, the default (case sensitive) URL looks something like...
			<pre>
			  https://localhost:4443/Phineas/console/console.html
			</pre>
			Replace the host, protocol, port, and console path based on how
			you have modified the Phineas configuration.  If you have secured
			the console your browser will	prompt you for the console 
			user/password (default "admin" and "changeit"). 
			<br>
			Click on the configuration icon 
			<img src="images/build.gif" alt="Configuration Icon" />
			and you'll see...
		</p>
		<center>
			<img src="screens/config.jpg" alt="The Configuration Console" />
		</center>
		<p>
		  You are now ready to inspect and update the <b>Phineas</b> configuration.
			Some common navigation and operation you should know are:
			<ul>
			  <li>Use the tabs to get to different parts of the configuration</li>
				<li>Folder or File (Unc) Paths
				  <ul>
					  <li>File system paths may use either forward or backward
						slashes.  However, URL paths may only use forward slashes.</li>
					  <li>Input folder paths may include standard wild cards to select
						files of interest.</li>
						<li>Output folder paths may include a common file prefix.  If you
						don't want common prefixes added be sure the path ends with a slash!
						</li>
						<li>A "Unc" is a file path that identify files not physically
						on the Phineas server (file system).  In the future this will
						include LDAP support.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Use the <b>NEW</b> tab to add configurations for things like 
				<b>Routes</b>	or <b>Maps</b></li>
				<li>Clear the first <b>Name</b> field for a tab item to delete it 
				(again for things like <b>Routes</b> or <b>Maps</b>)</li>
				<li>After adding a <b>NEW</b> item, changing it's <b>Name</b>, 
				or deleting an item (tab), <b>Update</b>
				the configuration from the <b>Load/Save/Update</b> tab in order 
				to expose	the change in the various drop downs</li>
				<li>Use <b>Load</b> and <b>Save</b> to use or preserve disk
				copies.  Note that <b>Save</b> will create date stamped backups.</li>
		  </ul>
		</p>			
		<hr/>
    <div class="heading">
      <a name="info" class="section" id=
      "info">Information You Will Need</a><br>
      <a href="#contents">(return to contents)</a>
    </div>
		<p>
		  As mentioned above, you need to know <b>WHAT</b> to
			configure if you have any hope of getting things to work.  Here is a list
			and <b>HOW</b> to get it.
		</p>
		<p>
		  All installations minimally need the following.  Depending on the
			endpoints you intend to communicate with, they may be self determined
			or provided. All are set to default values in a fresh install:
			<ul>
			  <li><b>PartyId</b> - often provided by the CDC, but may be user defined
				for non-CDC purposes (server domain name is a good choice).
				</li>
				<li><b>Organization</b> - that's all yours.</li>
				<li>Server <b>Port</b> and <b>SSL Port</b> - pick something that doesn't conflict
				with other HTTP services (IIS, Apache, etc) on your server.</li>
				<li>Server <b>SSL CertFile/KeyFile</b> - this is often a CDC issued 
				certificate, but may be issued by anyone agreed upon between you
				and your endpoints (e.g. self signed, or vendor signed).
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
		  If you are setting up a sender, the receiver's organization 
			(for example the CDC) should provide or suggest how to obtain the 
			following:
			<ul>
				<li>Route <b>PartyId</b></li>
				<li>Route <b>Host</b></li>
				<li>Route <b>Path</b></li>
				<li>Route <b>Port</b></li>
				<li>Route <b>Protocol</b> (http or https)</li>
				<li>optional Route <b>Authentication Unc</b> (certificate) or 
				<b>Authentication Id</b> (basic) and <b>Password</b></li>
				<li>Map <b>Service</b> and <b>Action</b></li>
				<li>optional Map <b>Arguments</b></li>
				<li>optional Map <b>Encryption Unc</b> (certificate)</li>
				<li>optional PEM encoded receiver certificate (signer chain) for 
				authenticating to be added to
				the <b>Phineas</b> sender's <b>Certificate Authority</b> file.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
		  If you are setting up a receiver, you need to define and provide the
			values above to your senders. Note
			any certificates provided should NOT contain private keys.  And please
			<font color="red">don't email Passwords</font>.  Use the phone!  
			The sender should subsequently
			provide you with a CPA and optional PEM encoded authentication 
			certificate which you would install in your server's <b>SSL AuthFile</b>.
		</p>

    <div class="heading">
      <a name="certs" class="section" id=
      "certs">Certificates</a><br>
      <a href="#contents">(return to contents)</a>
    </div>
		<p>
		  Certificates are used for SSL (HTTPS) negotiations,
			authentication, payload encryption, and digital 
			signitures.  As such they are an important part of the <b>Phineas</b>
			security model.
    <p>
      There are six possible certficate (files) involved. Three
      used by the sender and three used by the receiver. The have
      mostly analogous functions, but complement each other. For
      example, the sender normally has the receiver's certificate
      in it's certificate authority and vice versa. As
      programmers we are taught to never exceed 7 variables in a
      function, since that's about what the human mind is
      normally capable of dealing with simultaneously. This is
      pushing that limit (:-).
    </p>
    <p>
      For a receiver these are the important certificates...
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The server (receiver) SSL certficate - <b>General Settings
      =&gt; Server =&gt; SSLCertFile</b>, this identifies and authenticates a
      receiver to the sender during standard SSL negotiations
      (see 5).
      </li>
      <li>The server (receiver) Certificate Authority - <b>General
      Settings =&gt; Server =&gt; SSL AuthFile</b>, this is used by the
      receiver to authenticate a sender during SSL negotiations
      when client authentication is used (see 4). It is a list of
      "approved" sender certificates in PEM format.
      </li>
      <li>The server (receiver) decryption certificate (key) -
      <b>Receiver =&gt; Service Maps =&gt; Encryption Unc</b>, this can be just
      a bare private key, or a certificate holding a private key
      for decrypting the payload from a sender (see 6). Often
      this is the same as #1 above, but can be anything available
      to the sender below.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      For a sender these are the important certficates...
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The sender's authentication certificate - <b>Sender
      Configuration =&gt; Routes =&gt; Authentication Unc</b>, this
      identifies and authenticates a sender to the receiver
      during standard SSL negotiations (see receiver's #2 above).
      </li>
      <li>The sender's Certificate Authority - <b>Sender
      Configuration =&gt; Service Settings =&gt; Certificate Authority</b>,
      this is used by the sender to authenticate the receiver
      during SSL negotiations. It is a list of "approved"
      receiver certificates in PEM format (see receiver's #1 above).
      </li>
      <li>The receivers's public encryption certificate - <b>Sender
      Configuration =&gt; Maps =&gt; Encryption Unc</b>, this is a
      certificate holding a public key for encrypting the payload
      by a sender (see receiver's #3 above). Often this is the same as the
      receiver's #1 above, but can be anything provided by the
      receiver to the sender.
      </li>
    </ol>

		<p>
		  Be sure you have first read and understand the
			<a href="console.html?help.html#certificates">certificate HELP</a> 
			documentation. The following examples use openSSL and standard MS 
			commands.  Most of what follows may also be done using browser tools.
			Consult with your browser documentation for those procedures. Operations
			done with PKCS12 files will prompt you for a password. I'll
			use the stock Phineas certficates as examples.
		</p>
		<p>
		  <ul>
			  <li><b>openssl x509 -in phineas.pem -noout -text </b>
				lists the contents of a PEM encoded certificate.  Use this
				to inspect things like the DN (distinguished name), validity
				dates, signers, etc.</li>
				<li><b>openssl x509 -outform DER -in phineas.pem -out phineas.der</b>
				converts a PEM certificate to DER (binary) format.</li>
				<li><b>openssl x509 -inform DER -in phineas.der -noout -text </b>
				lists the contents of a DER encoded certificate.</li>			
				<li><b>openssl pkcs12 -nodes -info -in phineas.pfx</b>
				lists the contents of a PKCS12 (.pfx) certificate store.</li>
				<li><b>openssl pkcs12 -export -in phineas.pem -inkey phineaskey.pem 
				-out phineas.pfx</b> creates a PKCS12 certficate from PEM
				certificate and private key files.</li>
				<li><b>openssl pkcs12 -in phineas.pfx -out phineas.pem -nokeys -clcerts</b>
				extracts a PEM certficate having only the public key 
				from a PKCS12 file for use in a 
				authority file or for sender encryption.</li>
				<li><b>type phineas.pem >> phineas.ca</b> adds a certficate
			  to a certificate authority file (here named "phineas.ca").  
				You may later edit this authority file using any text editor.  
				Note that order	may be important.  Generally you want "root" 
				authorities at the end of the file.</li>

      <a name="filters" class="section" id="filters">Configuring Filters</a><br>
      <a href="#contents">(return to contents)</a>
    </div>
		<p>
		  Both the sender (Folder Map) and receiver (Service Map) may be
			configured to use a data filter.  The filter can be any non-interactive
			program you find useful for manipulating data as it comes or goes
			in <b>Phineas</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Enter a command in the <b>Filter</b> box just as you would enter
			it into a <b>Command</b> window prompt, with the following differences:
			<ul>
			  <li>The default command structure places input data on
				the "standard input" and get output data from the "standard output".</li>
				<li>Error or diagnostic messages are read from the "standard error"
				and noted in the <b>Phineas</b> log.</li>
			  <li>You must use a <b>Command</b> shell in order to get
				redirection or intrinsic MS commands (like 'DIR').</li>
				<li>No attempt is made to resolve relative paths in file names.
				Use complete paths to insure correct operation.</li>
				<li>If the command takes the input file name as an argument
				use '$in' as a placeholder for the input data.</li>
				<li>If the command takes the output file name as an argument
				use '$out' as a placeholder for the output data.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
		  Since filters are simply stand-alone programs, you can test your
			filters independent of <b>Phineas</b> from a <b>Command</b> window.
			Use redirection for testing actual payload files before 
			installing them into the configuration. Some examples of filters follow:
			<ul>
			  <li><b>SORT /R</b> - sort the data in reverse order.</li>
				<li><b>COPY c:/data/header.txt $in</b> - prefix the data with the contents of
				the file 'C:\data\header.txt'.</li>
				<li><b>FIND /V "NK1|"</b> - remove all the NK1 segments from an
				HL7 message.</li>
				<li><b>CMD /C/Q c:/bin/myfilter.bat $in $out</b> - runs the batch file
				'C:\bin\myfilter.bat' which expects an input and output file name as arguments.
				This batch file could in turn execute multiple programs to modify
				the data.</li>
			</ul>

    </div>
		<p>
		  The <b>Phineas</b> "server" is required for using either a
			receiver, or the console.  As a result some of it's functions
			overlap.  In particular, the receiver and console share the
			same "listen" ports and SSL security settings.

    </div>
		<p>
		  The server secures general sessions using HTTPS (SSL) and is
			in fact a stand-alone (albeit limited functoning) web server.
			Set up the server SSL connection under the 
			<b>General Settings =&gt; Server</b> tab.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Fill in the <b>SSL Port</b> (443 is the standard HTTPS port).  Make sure
			it doesn't conflict with other services (like IIS or Apache!).  Set
			the <b>SSL CertFile</b> to your server certificate.  This can be one issued
			by the CDC, one obtained from a certficate authority (like AddTrust or
			Thawte), or self signed. It can be in PKCS12, DER, or PEM format.
			Set the <b>SSL KeyFile</b> to your private key.  This is often the same file
			as the certficate.  Enter the <b>SSL Password</b> used to encrypt the certificate
			and/or keyfile (they must both use the same password).

			Client Authentication</a><br>
      <a href="#contents">(return to contents)</a>
    </div>
		<p>
		  <b>Phineas</b> uses files that have one or more PEM encoded certficates
			for authenticating SSL connections.  This authentication is performed
			by either side of the connection (sender or receiver) based on
			whether an authorization file has been specified.  The server 
			(receiver) authenticates browsers and/or sender clients by setting
		  <b>SSL Auth File</b> in the <b>General Settings =&gt; Server</b> tab
			(see above)

      <a href="#contents">(return to contents)</a>
    </div>
		<p>
		  The console is secured in a standard installation with user 
			"admin" and password "changeit".  It uses HTTP <b>basic</b> authentication
			where a web browser pops open a login window.  As such it should
			normally be used with HTTPS (SSL), since the password and user ID are
			otherwise passed in clear text over the internet.
		</p>
		<img src="screens/console.jpg" alt="Console Users" class="right"/>
		<p>
		  Access the console user configuation using the 
			<b>Server Settings =&gt; Console</b> tab and modify tabs under
			<b>Console Users</b>.
		  To delete a console user simple remove the User ID.  To add one use
			the NEW tab.  To modify one change either the User ID or Password
			of the selected entry.

		  The receiver can has it's own list of user/passwords for HTTP

		  <b>Service Maps</b> are used by the receiver to determine how or if
			incoming messages should be received.  They must include a 
			<b>Directory</b> (folder) path where the messages get stored, the 
			<b>Queue</b> used to log incoming message information, and 
			a <b>Service</b> and <b>Action</b> provided
			to senders and used to route the incoming message.

		  Sender's may encrypt payloads using the public key from a receiver's
			certificate.  Typically the receiver simply uses it's server
			certificate, but may optionally provide different 
			(possibly privately distributed) certificates for payload encryption.
			Select "certificate" for
			the <b>Encryption Type</b> and fill in the <b>Encryption Password</b> and
			<b>Encryption Unc</b> with the file name of the certificate 
			(private key).
