    <h3>
      Introduction
    </h3><b>Phineas</b> is a CDC <b>PHINMS</b> ebXML compatible
    transport system with hooks for syncronous message
    processing. If that seems like an archane bunch of
    gibberish... well it probably is. So think about it this way.
    You have data files. You want to automate file delivery from
    one place to another. You want to simply put a file into a
    folder and have it magically appear in a specific folder
    somewhere else in the big bad internet. That's what
    <b>Phineas</b> does, but with guaruteed delivery, auditing,
    logging, security, and full HIPAA compliance.<br>

    <h3>
      Navigation
    </h3>If you made it this far, you must be running the
    <b>Phineas</b> console. You'll notice a bunch of icons at the
    top. Click on these to get various functions of the console.
    The following lists possible activities.<br>
    <br>
    <table summary="Phineas navigation">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <img src="images/queue.ico" alt="show queues">
        </td>
        <td>
          Show the Queues. <b>Phineas</b> tracks all transport
          activity in what are called queues. Basically these are
          tables with information about each file sent or
          received. The entries are color coded so that you can
          easily see issues. By selecting a record you get a
          detailed report below the queue list.
        </td>
      </tr>
     <tr>
        <td>
          <img src="images/ping.ico" alt="ping route">
        </td>
        <td>
          Send an ebXML "Ping" to selected route. Use this to
          test route connectivity and connectivity.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width='80'>
          <img src="images/log.ico" alt="show logging">
        </td>
        <td>
          Show the log. The amount and type of information found
          in the log will vary depending on the Log Level. Beware
          that if <b>Phineas</b> has been running a long time,
          this log could be quite large!
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <img src="images/loop.ico" alt="show configuration">
        </td>
        <td>
          Show the configuration. <b>Phineas</b> is configured
          using a single XML configuration file. The current
          running configuration is shown. This may be different
          than the configuration being edited.
        </td>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <img src="images/build.ico" alt="edit configuration">
        </td>
        <td>
          Edit Configuration. This is a set of forms that you can
          use to modify a <b>Phineas</b> configuration, or export
          a CPA. Configuration parameter are documented below.

          function.

    <h3>
      Configuration
    </h3>While Phineas doesn't (yet) have as many configuration
    parameters as PHINMS, there is still plenty of stuff to
    tweak. The good news is that generally speaking you won't
    have to touch much (or any) of it. In fact it's very possible
    to generate a Phineas distribution that doesn't allow (easy)
    modification of the configuration.
